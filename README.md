TODO:
 - Losing mass to move faster
 - A Flag indicating other planet mass (lager or smaller)
 - Change the view of player (height of camera)
 - Add different hazards and special features
 - Attacking hazard will hit and damage planet
 - Black hole
 - Customizable texture
 - Particle system for nicer looking and behaviour effects

Bugs:
- Client disappear unexpectedly (network issue? ) [checkning]
- Small mass hazard could not be absorbed [checking]
- After frequent absorbing and leaving other planets, big planets keep growing up unexpectedly
- When player reborn, all players could see the reborn trace (planet move fast from dead position to reborn position)
